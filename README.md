# VLSD
An augmented reality experience in the style of a psychedelic trip. VLSD is a DIY AR project that uses an iPad/iPhone camera and display to create psychedelic styled visuals that augment and change the world around you. Used in harmony with Schumanns Resonance (Binaural sound) VLSD is intended to be used as a form of technological therapy/meditation for individuals suffering with anxiety and depression (VLSD is a sister project to Techno-Psychedelic Therapy Ⓡ) - Feel free to edit files and create custom versions but VLSD is subject to copyright and cannot be monetised or used to create revenue - ConnerEastwood©

**Must lock iPad/iPhone rotation to portrait**
VLSD is a development of GPUimage : https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage
VLSD is presently in Alpha, awaiting further development.
